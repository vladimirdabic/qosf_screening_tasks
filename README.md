# QOSF Screening Tasks
This repository holds the solutions to the cohort 11 screening tasks.

As I was not initially sure if we were allowed to use libraries such as Qiskit or PennyLane, I've developed a small library under the name [qipy](https://github.com/vladimirdabic/qipy). In this repo, it appears as *qlib*, which was its initial name, but it's taken on PyPI.

For those who wish, qipy can be installed from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/qipy/) via `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qipy`
